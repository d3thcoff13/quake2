This is a grenade mod that replaces all weapons with different grenade types. To use the mod, just start a 
multiplayer match and find a grenade pickup. The grenades laying on the ground are are grenade parts, which 
can be used to craft the new grenades. To craft a grenade, use the number keys 0-9 (though only 1-7 are 
working) to select a grenade, then hold the right mouse button to craft it. You cannot craft a grenade 
that you don't have parts for.
